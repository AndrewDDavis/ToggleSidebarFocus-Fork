# Sublime Text ToggleSidebarFocus

A plugin for Sublime Text that allows you to open, focus, and close the sidebar using the same keyboard shortcut.

## Installation

Install `ToggleSidebarFocus` through Package Control (though this fork must be installed manually, by downloading it and moving it to the Packages dir).

## Usage

Open your `sublime-keymap` file from `Preferences -> Key Bindings` in Sublime Text, and assign your preferred keyboard shortcut to the `toggle_sidebar_and_focus` command.

```json
{
    "keys": ["Ctrl+0"],
    "command": "toggle_sidebar_and_focus"
},
